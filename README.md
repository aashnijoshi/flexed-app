## what is flexed?

flexed adapts to **how often you actually work out**, not how often you wish you did.

- generates workouts based on availability + energy
- removes streak pressure and “all or nothing” plans
- designed for people who want consistency without rigidity

## live app

https://vercel.com/aashnijoshi-2583s-projects/v0-kinda-fit-app

---

## stack

- v0.app (ui + iteration)
- vercel (deployment)
- react / next.js (via v0)

---

## development workflow

this repo stays in sync with v0.app:
1. build and iterate in v0
2. deploy from v0
3. changes auto-push here
4. vercel deploys the latest version

still early. building in public.
